#The URL for our Team GitHub repository is https://github.com/ye25/MarketingAnalytcisTeamProject

#Dataset Problem 1: Too many repetitive columns. Though this can be thoughful to cover all the types of answers, this is redundant in analyzing the data. 
#Dataset Problem 2: Most nummerical columns have a categorical column to explain. This process is pretty uncessary because numerical is more powerful in analyzing the data. Moreover, the catogircal means can be explained in the data dictionary part. 

#The managerial objective of this dataset is to precisely decide if the housing mortgage should be approved based on candidates' information. Final managerial objective:  - Where are mortgages most likely to be approved?     - Can we predict mortgage decisions based on the criteria provided here?


#clean the data

```{r}
